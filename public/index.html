            <b>Notice about hosting on Azure & HTTP:</b> A web app on Azure uses NGINX and load balancers
            for reverse proxying. All HTTPS requests to the Azure server terminate at the load balancer and
            is then passed on as a regular HTTP request which is why you must use <code>http.createServer()</code>
            and not <code>https.createServer()</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            CosmosDB is a NoSQL database hosted on Azure. Use the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/" target="blank">Azure Resource Storage Explorer</a>
            with the appropriate subscription ID to access the stored data. The subscription ID can be obtained via the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="blank">Azure Portal</a>.
