    <main>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          The purposes of this application is to log user entries to a database to record when and
          for which reason a student enters the SVL office.

        <h3>Routes</h3>
        <hr>
        <section>
          <h4>Accessing Routes</h4>

          <h4>POST Routes</h4>
          <h5>/student/logStudent</h5>
          <p>
            Use <code>/student/logStudent</code> to POST a student entry to the database.
            The POST body must be a <code>JSON</code> body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each request must have a student identifier which can be one of the following:
            <ul>
              <li><code>magStripCode</code>: Magstrip code from a card swipe</li>
              <li><code>netId</code>: Student's UW Net ID</li>
              <li><code>sid</code>: Student number</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p> Alongside the student identifier, a reason must be included as to why the student is trying to sign in.</p>
          <p>
            A successful response from the API looks like:
            <pre>
              <code>
                {
                  "name": "Student name",
                  "netid": "Student netId",
                  "sid": "Student number",
                  "reason": "Logging in to study",
                  "timestamp": "Fri Nov 12 2021 02:38:36 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)",
                  "text": "Student name has successfully signed in at Fri Nov 12 2021 02:38:36 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time) to: Logging in to study",
                  "id": "#########-#############-#############-###########"
                }
              </code>
            </pre>
            The <code>id</code> field is the insertion ID inside of CosmosDB. This ID can be used to find a specific record.
          </p>
        </section>

        <h3>Underlying Technologies</h3>
        <hr>
        <section>
          <p>The implementation for this backend is built on a couple of different technologies:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>NodeJS</li>
            <li>Express</li>
            <li>HTTP (Why HTTP is used instead of HTTPS is explained under Azure Hosting)</li>
            <li>CosmosDB</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            CosmosDB is a NoSQL database hosted on Azure. Use the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/" target="blank">Azure Resource Storage Explorer</a>
            with the appropriate subscription ID to access the stored data. The subscription ID can be obtained via the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="blank">Azure Portal</a>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <h3>Azure Hosting</h3>
        <hr>
        <section>
          <h4>Why HTTP and not HTTPS?</h4>
          <p>
            A web app on Azure uses NGINX and load balancers
            for reverse proxying. All HTTPS requests to the Azure server terminate at the load balancer and
            is then passed on as a regular HTTP request which is why you must use <code>http.createServer()</code>
            and not <code>https.createServer()</code>.
          </p>

          <h4>Accessing Azure Resources</h4>
          <p>
            To access and manage all Azure Resources, please visit the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="blank">Azure Portal</a>.
            From here, you can create, delete, and edit resources within a subscription. These resources are under the
            "Student Veteran Life" subscription.
          </p>

          <h4>Resource Groups</h4>
